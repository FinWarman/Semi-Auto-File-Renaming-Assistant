# The Semi-Automatic File Renaming Assistant

A tool to assist with renaming a bulk of files (designed for images), where this cannot be fully automated as there is not enough information in the metadata to generate useful names.
This tool allows configuration of naming templates, where inidividual sections of the name can be manual edited based on the preview of the file.
